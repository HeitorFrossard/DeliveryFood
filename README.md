The two new technologies that we implemented in our term project were Ajax, JSON, and web services. The JSON technology is implemented in the inc files inside the ws folder. These files read if there is a callback to the web service, and if there is grab the specified database/callback and encode the JSON data. The Ajax technology is implemented in the javascript folder files. These provide a call to a certain URL and if the connection is successful it stores data into a variable and grabs that data.

Technology X- Ajax
Technology X- The ability to send and retrieve data in the background without interfering with the display of the present page. It does not have to refresh the page to show the data and therefore not only makes the webpage faster, but also does not interfere with the users UI on the existing page.
Technology X- app.js
	            Business.js
	            Customer.js
URL X- https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp
